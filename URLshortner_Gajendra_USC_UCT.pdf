Industrial Internship Report on
”URL SHORTNER”
Prepared by
Gajendra Singh

Executive Summary
This report provides details of the Industrial Internship provided by upskill Campus and The IoT Academy in collaboration with Industrial Partner UniConverge Technologies Pvt Ltd (UCT).
This internship was focused on a project/problem statement provided by UCT. We had to finish the project including the report in 6 weeks’ time.
My project was a URL shortner which shortens the long urls in short ones.
This internship gave me a very good opportunity to get exposure to Industrial problems and design/implement solution for that. It was an overall great experience to have this internship.

3	Problem Statement
●	URL Shortener:

Description: The URL shortener is a Python project that converts long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. It takes a long URL as input, generates a unique shortened URL, and redirects users to the original URL when the shortened link is accessed.

Scope: The scope of this project involves designing a user interface to input long URLs and display the shortened links, implementing a database to store the mapping between original and shortened URLs, and developing functions to generate unique shortened URLs and handle redirection.



 
4	Existing and Proposed solution

The other solution proposed before are very long nd bacty which consist of Django application . These solution are very log without using the python lybraries
I proposed a very short solution by using libraries of pyhton like pyshortners and pyperclip to take the longer url as an input. 
And I used tkinter to give user interrface

5	Proposed Design/ Model

Given more details about design flow of your solution. This is applicable for all domains. DS/ML Students can cover it after they have their algorithm implementation. There is always a start, intermediate stages and then final outcome.

5.2	Low Level Diagram (if applicable)






5.3	Interfaces (if applicable)
Update with Block Diagrams, Data flow, protocols, FLOW Charts, State Machines, Memory Buffer Management.

           

 
6	Performance Test

This is very important part and defines why this work is meant of Real industries, instead of being just academic project.
Here we need to first find the constraints. 
How those constraints were taken care in your design?
What were test results around those constraints?
Constraints can be e.g. memory, MIPS (speed, operations per second), accuracy, durability, power consumption etc.
In case you could not test them, but still you should mention how identified constraints can impact your design, and what are recommendations to handle them.

6.3	Performance Outcome

 
7	My learnings

You should provide summary of your overall learning and how it would help you in your career growth. 
8	Future work scope

You can put some ideas that you could not work due to time limitation but can be taken in future.
